## Migration Guide

### From Manual Enrichment
If you previously enriched products manually:

1. Back up your Products table
2. Run the schema setup script
3. Test with a small batch (5-10 products)
4. Review results before full deployment
5. Gradually increase batch sizes

### Database Considerations
- Ensure sufficient storage for CustomMemo fields
- Plan for log table growth (recommend monthly archival)
- Monitor database performance during batch processing
- Consider off-peak hours for large batches

---

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- Google Custom Search API has daily quota limits (100 searches/day for free tier)
- OpenAI API can be expensive for large batches
- Image analysis is heuristic-based (not pixel-level yet)
- No built-in duplicate detection
- Manual review required for low-confidence results

### Workarounds
- Use Gemini for cost-effective processing
- Implement caching to reduce API calls
- Process in smaller batches during testing
- Monitor API usage through provider dashboards
- Use fallback rules when AI unavailable

### Reporting Issues
Include:
- Node.js version
- Database version
- Error logs from `logs/` directory
- Sample product data (sanitized)
- Steps to reproduce

### Development
The project follows modular architecture:
- Each service is independent
- Singleton pattern for shared resources
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive logging
