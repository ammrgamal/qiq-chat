#### Pricing Principles
1. Land & expand: start with low-friction supplier tier (Starter) to seed network density.
2. Usage ‚Üí value mapping: AI & WhatsApp priced by actual leverage (calls / conversations).
3. Sponsorship staged after reaching minimum viable data volume (‚â• 50 active suppliers, ‚â• 3k monthly quotes).
4. Data products only after reliable enrichment quality (‚â• 85% classification confidence median) + compliance review.

#### Rollout Timeline (Indicative)
| Quarter | Focus | KPI Gate |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Q1 | Supplier subscription onboarding | 30 paying suppliers |
| Q2 | Commission + AI OCR module | 15% quotes w/ OCR ingestion |
| Q3 | WhatsApp Bot premium + sponsorship pilots | 2 sponsors signed |
| Q4 | Data dashboards + QuoteWerks automation | 1k dashboard MAU |

#### Core KPI Dashboard (Monetization)
Group | Metrics
------|--------
Acquisition | New suppliers / month, CAC proxy
Activation | % suppliers uploading price lists
Retention | Supplier churn %, bot returning users
Monetization | ARPU, MRR growth, GMV
Product Usage | OCR jobs/day, AI enrichment latency, quote creation velocity
Quality | Classification confidence median, enrichment coverage %, WhatsApp bot completion rate

#### Expansion Levers
- Cross-sell: AI module ‚Üí Data dashboards.
- Up-sell: Starter ‚Üí Pro triggered by usage thresholds (quotes/month or API calls).
- Network effect: More suppliers ‚Üí better pricing intelligence ‚Üí stronger sponsorship pitch.

#### Risk Mitigations
Risk | Mitigation
-----|-----------
Low supplier adoption | Lower entry tier + assisted onboarding
AI accuracy concerns | Hybrid human validation queue for outliers
WhatsApp compliance changes | Abstract provider layer; fallback to web capture
Data privacy concerns | Anonymization + opt-out controls
QuoteWerks API fragility | Local connector watchdog + retry strategy
